# File Analysis: `js/libs/fullcalendar/fullcalendar.min.css`

## High-Level Overview

This file is the minified production stylesheet for the FullCalendar library (v3.10.0), a third-party JavaScript component used by the Easy Appointments plugin. Its sole purpose is to provide the visual styling for the interactive calendars displayed within the plugin.

As a minified asset (`.min.css`), it is optimized for performance by removing all whitespace, comments, and formatting. It is functionally identical to `fullcalendar.css` but is intended for use on live websites to reduce page load times. This file works in direct conjunction with `fullcalendar.js` to render a complete, functional, and styled calendar.

## Detailed Explanation

This file contains only CSS rules. It does not include any PHP, JavaScript, or WordPress hooks. The code consists of a single, long line of CSS selectors and properties that target the HTML structure generated by the `fullcalendar.js` library.

Key styled components include:
-   `.fc-toolbar`: The header section with navigation buttons (prev, next, today) and view switchers (month, week, day).
-   `.fc-day-grid-event`: The visual representation of an appointment event within the month or week view.
-   `.fc-time-grid-event`: The visual representation of an event in the time-gridded day view.
-   `.fc-event`: General styles for all calendar events, including colors, borders, and text.
-   `.fc-highlight`: Styling for helper selections, like when a user clicks and drags to select a time slot.
-   `.fc-bgevent`: Styling for background events.

This file has no direct interaction with the WordPress database or server-side APIs. It is a static asset loaded by the browser and applied to the Document Object Model (DOM).

## Features Enabled

### Admin Menu

-   **Reports Calendar:** This stylesheet is loaded on the admin page under "Appointments -> Reports *NEW*". It styles the calendar that displays past and upcoming appointments, allowing administrators to visualize bookings.

### User-Facing

-   **Full Calendar Shortcode & Block:** The primary user-facing feature is the calendar displayed via the `[ea_full_calendar]` shortcode or the "Easy Appointments FullCalendar" Gutenberg block. This file provides all the necessary styling for that front-end calendar, ensuring it is rendered correctly for site visitors.

## Extension Opportunities

**Do not edit `fullcalendar.min.css` directly.** It is a third-party, minified file, and any direct modifications will be lost if the plugin is updated. Furthermore, its unreadable format makes editing impractical and risky.

The recommended way to customize the calendar's appearance is to override the default styles using your own CSS.

1.  **Create a Custom Stylesheet:** Create a new CSS file (e.g., `my-ea-custom-styles.css`) in your child theme's directory.
2.  **Enqueue the Stylesheet:** Use the `wp_enqueue_scripts` action in your child theme's `functions.php` to load your stylesheet. Ensure it loads *after* the plugin's styles by specifying dependencies or using a higher priority.

**Example: Change the default event color**

To change the default blue background color of calendar events to a shade of green, you could add the following CSS to your custom stylesheet:

```css
/* /wp-content/themes/your-child-theme/my-ea-custom-styles.css */

/* Override the default FullCalendar event background and border color */
.fc-event {
    background-color: #28a745 !important; /* A bootstrap 'success' green */
    border-color: #28a745 !important;
}
```

You would then enqueue this file like so:

```php
// In your child theme's functions.php
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'my_custom_ea_styles', 20 );

function my_custom_ea_styles() {
    wp_enqueue_style(
        'my-ea-custom-styles',
        get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/my-ea-custom-styles.css',
        ['ea-front-style'], // Make sure it loads after the plugin's main style
        '1.0.0'
    );
}
```

## Next File Recommendations

1.  **`easy-appointments/ea-blocks/ea-blocks.php`**: This file is responsible for registering the plugin's Gutenberg blocks, including the FullCalendar block. Analyzing it will reveal how the server-side rendering of modern WordPress editor components is handled and how they are configured.
2.  **`easy-appointments/css/eafront.css`**: This is the main custom stylesheet for the plugin's front-end booking form. Understanding its structure is key to customizing the overall look and feel of the user booking experience, beyond just the calendar.
3.  **`easy-appointments/ea-blocks/src/ea-fullcalendar/index.js`**: This is the client-side entry point for the FullCalendar Gutenberg block. It will show how the block is implemented using JavaScript, how it interacts with the WordPress block editor's state (`attributes`), and how it initializes the FullCalendar library in the admin editor context.
